Weapon Design
---------------------
Need to implement weapon states
if a weapon is reloading, call Reload()
if a weapon is firing, call Fire()
and; Idle(), Empty()

Prevent having to set explicit timers for things by using the states, and tracking the amount of time spent in each state


Sound Effect Component
---------------------
Build a way to load a 'sound bank' which will be a group of related sounds. For example,
firing sounds for the SMG, would be one bank. Then, have a way to play a random sound from
an specified bank.

During content load, individual weapon configuration files are read to create the weapon banks. 


World Manager
---------------------
Some things to think about for world management...
 1: Do we need managers for related entities? ie; Items (drops, gear, weapons, mats), Projectiles (bullets, casts, bombs), Actors (player, enemies, NPCS)
 2: Is the world instanced or static? What do we get from either method?
 3: When do we start thinking about serialization?


Misc
---------------------
Size = how big something is or how many something can hold
Count = how many something currently has

ex:
MagSize = how many rounds a magazine can hold
MagCount = how many rounds a magazine currently holds
