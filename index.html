  <b>Game Design</b><br>
  I gave the weekly state of the game presentation to my supporter.<br><br>
  
  <b>Technical Design</b><br>
  There is a great post on stackoverflow about <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5458760/game-architecture/5459955#5459955">general game architecture</a> that I came across today. It helped me understand how game objects are
  tracked and made me think about iterfaces as they relate to games, and how I should be using them. It was a bit of an 'Aha!' moment for me. There are a lot of things I'm not sure how I'm going to do, this article helped me get a little
  closer to checking one of those things off the list. I wanted to see a little more info about the guy that made the post, so I checked his profile to find out that he is the Lead Engine Developer for <a href="http://rivercityransom.com/sheet.php?p=river_city_ransom_underground">River City Ransom: Underground</a>.

  <b>Game Design</b><br>
  I drew a mockup of the DPS tester, storyboard pane #7, and took a bunch of notes on how it will function.<br><br>
  
  <b>Technical Design</b><br>
  I extracted a couple of classes from the Player() object to make them usable for other characters. It doesn't seem like much 
  in writing, but it ended up being a fair amount of code.

  <b>Game Design</b>
  <ul>
   <li>wrote a dream sequence featuring the main character</li>
   <li>drew up some plans for how gun mods may work</li>
   <li>wrote a few paragraphs of 'World' backstory</li>
   <li>started a list of 'things to try'</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Technical Design</b><br>
  I did more work on the prototype, specifically on animated sprites, adding a feature that allows sprite animations to play out of order frames from the
  sprite sheet.

  <b>2017.12.10 - Sunday</b><br>
  I installed the <a href="http://www.monogame.net">monogame tools</a> and intend to use them to build a prototype. I want the prototype to have:<br>
  <ul>
   <li>a moving character</li>
   <li>animated sprites</li>
   <li>a weapon that shoots bullets</li>
   <li>hit scan bullets</li>
   <li>traveling bullets</li>
   <li>joystick input</li>
   <li>a few sounds</li>
  </ul>

  For the prototype, I'm using sprite resources from <a href="http://kenney.nl/assets">Kenney Assets</a>.<br><br>
  I also added a couple of design edicts to the list (see top of page).
